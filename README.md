# TikTokTrendingSongs

TikTok has taken the social media world by storm. As data continues to pour out, more questions will could be posed as the application continues to grow. This project explores the audio features of songs that were trending on TikTok during a one month period using pandas and the Spotify API. The dataset was provided by [Erik van de Ven on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/erikvdven/tiktok-trending-december-2020) and includes trending songs from December 2020. 

You can explore the results in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/WesH0use/TikTokTrendingSongs/blob/main/TikTok%20Trending%20Data%20Analysis%20.ipynb).
